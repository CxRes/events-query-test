# Introduction {#introduction}

{: #intro-http-traditional-use}
HTTP was originally designed for transferring static documents within a single request and response. HTTP does not automatically inform clients of changes to a document. This design was adequate for web pages that were mostly static and written by hand.

{: #intro-real-time-needs}
But web-applications today are dynamic, requiring instantaneous updates from sources. The many workarounds developed over the years to provide real-time updates for resources using HTTP have proven to be inadequate. Web programmers instead resort to implementing custom messaging systems over alternate protocols such as WebSockets {{WS}}, which requires additional layers of code, typically involving non-standard JavaScript frameworks to provide event notifications. It also requires additional work to coordinate a representation and notifications that are served on different protocols.

{: #intro-events-query}
{{&protocol}} is a minimal protocol built on top of {{HTTP}} that allows applications to request event notifications directly from a resource of interest using the `QUERY` method ({{HTTP-QUERY, Section 3}}).

{: #intro-convinience}
The objective of this specification is to make the request and receipt of event notifications extremely convenient for consumers. Programmers implementing {{&protocol}} shall no longer be forced to switch to another protocol to incorporate real-time functionality in their web applications. Not only that, web-applications shall receive a representation and notifications in a single response, obviating any need for co-ordination and saving on unnecessary roundtrips.

{: #intro-fetch-example keepWithNext="true"}
With the help of a suitable composite media-type parser, {{&protocol}} responses can be consumed with just a few lines of code, as illustrated in the JavaScript example below:

~~~ js
const response = fetch('http://example.com', {
  method: 'QUERY',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Accept: 'application/http'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    state: { Accept: 'text/plain' },
    events: { Accept: 'example/event-request' }
  })
});

const splitResponse = splitHTTPResponseStream(response);
// splits the response into an iterable of representation and notifications

const representation = await splitResponse.next();
// Isolate the representation
// API identical to fetch Response

for await (const notification of splitResponse) {
  // do something with a notification
  // API identical to fetch Response
}
~~~

{: #intro-content-negotiation}
Unlike other HTTP based event notification mechanisms, {{&protocol}} supports content negotiation for notifications, just like representations. Thus, the {{&protocol}} protocol preserves the flexibility of interaction afforded by HTTP and extends it to notifications.

{: #intro-sync}
When combined with suitable synchronization mechanisms like Conflict Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) or Operational Transforms (OT), such event notifications can be used create representations that are "live" for user agents. This has the potential to immensely simplify the task of programming multi-author distributed real-time applications.
