# Notification Stream {#stream}

{: #stream-description}
Instead of long-polling for event-notifications, {{&protocol}} can also be used request a stream ({{RFC6202, Section 3}}) of multiple event-notifications.

## Request {#stream-request}

{: #stream-request-procedure}
To request a stream of event-notifications from a resource in an {{&protocol}}, a client MUST express the interest in receiving the event-notifications in a preferred form using a realization of the subscription data model with the `QUERY` method ({{HTTP-QUERY, Section 3}}).

{: #stream-request-conneg}
A client can also negotiate the response that encapsulates event-notifications using header fields. Since the response carries an encapsulating representation, header fields can no longer be used to negotiate the form of an event-notification itself like in the case of a [Single Notification Request](#single-notification-request){:noabbrev}.

{: #stream-request-example-description}
The following example shows subscription request for a stream of event-notifications transmitted using the `application/http` media-type. The `events` property indicates the interest in receiving event-notifications. Preferences are specified using the request headers in the `events` property.

## Response {#stream-response}

{: #stream-response-encapsution}
The response stream encapsulates multiple event-notifications (typically, but not necessarily) in a composite media-type. We shall be using `application/http` media-type ({{-HTTP1, Section 10.2}}) for the purpose of illustration.

### Headers {#stream-response-header}

{: #stream-response-headers-list}
A server able to provide a stream of event-notifications immediately sends the header which MUST include:

+ {: #stream-response-events-field}
The =Events= header field to communicate the properties of the notifications stream.

    + {: #stream-response-duration-property}
    The =duration= property set with the time for which the server intends to serve notifications.

+ {: #stream-response-incremental-field}
The `Incremental` header field ({{INCREMENTAL-HTTP-MESSAGES, Section 3}}) set to `?1` to indicate that the response is to be immediately forwarded by intermediaries and not buffered.

### Notifications {#stream-response-body}

{: #stream-response-event}
Subsequently, when event(s) occur, the server transmits a notification identical to the [Single Notification Response](#single-notification-response){:noabbrev}, except header fields redundant with response header ({{stream-response-header}}) are omitted.

~~~ http-message


{::include examples/notifications/update.http}
~~~
{: sourcecode-name="stream-update-event.http" #stream-update-event title="Update Notification"}

{: #stream-response-terminal-event}
A server MUST end the response immediately after transmitting the event-notification upon a resource being deleted.

~~~ http-message


{::include examples/notifications/delete.http}
~~~
{: sourcecode-name="stream-delete-event.http" #stream-delete-event title="Delete Notification"}

{: #stream-response-timeout}
Otherwise, a server MUST end the response when the connection duration has exceeded the period set in the =duration= property of the =Events= header field. A server MAY terminate the response earlier.
