A user agent can discover if a server enables {{&protocol}} on a resource by examining support for query with a media-type that can realize the {{<<data-model}}. A server MUST advertise media-types accepted for {{&protocol}} using the `Accept-Query` header field ({{HTTP-QUERY, Section 3}}) in a response.

> **Implementation Advice**
>
> Servers are advised against enabling event-notifications on long-lived resources over HTTP. A resource might be considered long-lived, if a server determines a low probability of an event on the resource in the duration of the response. In such instances, servers are strongly advised to respond with the `Cache-Control` ({{HTTP-CACHING, Section 5}}) header field and the `max-age` parameter ({{HTTP-CACHING, Section 5.2.2.1}}) set in it.
